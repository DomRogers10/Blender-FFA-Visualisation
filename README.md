# Blender-FFA-Visualisation
My work experience at RAL (03/07/2023 - 07/07/2023) led me to work on a Blender visualisation for an FFA (Fixed Field Accelerator). Here are the results!


Some notes: uploaded from RAL computer, so main files can be found outside of folders. All files in "everything" and the main blender files in "Visualisation"
